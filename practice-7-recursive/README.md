# PROG 2400 - Exercise 7


### Task

Using the included *isTargetPresentLooping* function as a guide, implement the recursive version of the function, which is called *isTargetPresentRecursive*, in **searcher.cpp**. This new function should recursively search through a sorted vector in order to determine if a given value is in the vector or not by repeatedly searching either the higher or lower half of the remaining vector locations.

The only change you should need to make in **main.cpp** should be to report the **Big O analysis** of the time complexity of each of the two functions in the appropriate output messages.

Only the **main.cpp** and **searcher.cpp** files should be modified.
  
The images below shows the final expected output (with Time Complexity hidden):

### Instructions:
-   Clone this repository to your local machine, make changes in CLion so all tests pass, and then commit and push the entire project up to GitHub
-   You should then be able to see your raw score on GitHub out of 10 as shown in class. The final grade will depend on the time of submission, see below:

#### Marking Scheme
Final Grade | Requirement
:---: | ---
|**10/10** | Exercise is correct (passes all tests) and is completed within the allotted in-class time.
|**8/10** | Exercise is correct (passes all tests) and is completed within a 12-hour grace period beginning immediately following the end of in-class time.
|**6/10** | Exercise is correct (passes all tests) and is completed and submitted after the 12-hour grace period has elapsed.
|**0/10** | Exercise is not submitted or does not pass all tests.
