# PROG 2400 - Exercise 2


### Task
We  are given code in the main.cpp file which already populates a vector with the Fibonacci sequence up to a certain limit. As a reminder, Fibonacci numbers look like so:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21

If you want more information on the Fibonacci sequence, please refer to:
[Fibonacci number - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number)
  
We are also provided with mostly empty functions to print the sequence, find the highest element, and find the average of the Fibonacci sequence. It is our job to implement these functions and to **print the time complexity of each in Big O Notation**. For time complexity, we will consider **N** to be the number of items stored in the vector holding the Fibonacci numbers.

**NOTE: THE FIBONACCI SEQUENCE IS SORTED BY DEFAULT.** 
  
The image below shows the final expected output (with Time Complexity hidden):

### Instructions:
-   Clone this repository to your local machine, make changes in CLion so all tests pass, and then commit and push the entire project up to GitHub
-   You should then be able to see your raw score on GitHub out of 10 as shown in class. The final grade will depend on the time of submission, see below:

#### Marking Scheme
Final Grade | Requirement
:---: | ---
|**10/10** | Exercise is correct (passes all tests) and is completed within the allotted in-class time.
|**8/10** | Exercise is correct (passes all tests) and is completed within a 12-hour grace period beginning immediately following the end of in-class time.
|**6/10** | Exercise is correct (passes all tests) and is completed and submitted after the 12-hour grace period has elapsed.
|**0/10** | Exercise is not submitted or does not pass all tests.
