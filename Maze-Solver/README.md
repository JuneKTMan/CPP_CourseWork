# PROG 2400 - Assignment 2 - Maze Solver


## Task

For this assignment, you are tasked to build a console application that will solve a given maze. The maze will be given to you as a simple text file. The file will contain a 25x25 maze that will use the pipe (|), hyphen (‐) and plus sign (+) to represent the maze walls.

Your application will then read the maze file and, using stacks and/or queues, produce the solution to the maze as a second text file. The solution through the maze will be noted using another character, such as the pound sign (#).

The MakeFile assumes that you will store your Stack or Queue in a file called **container.cpp**.

**NOTE: For the sake of simplicity, you may assume the maze is always a 25x25 grid. However, you cannot assume the maze itself is always the same (i.e. the solution could change, as it will when running the tests). You can also assume that the maze always starts at the top left‐hand corner and ends at the bottom right‐hand corner.**

**NOTE: You should have a destructor on your Container class that goes through the list and deletes all of the Nodes.**

## Submission Instructions
### Video Recording Submission:

You will demonstrate the completion of this project via a **video screen-capture recording** of you using CLion, GitBash, and viewing your code to show completion of the **Video Submission Checklist**, which is posted on Brightspace. You will post **either your video file or a link to it** (e.g. a Microsoft Stream recording, make sure to give the instructor permissions to watch it), to the Brightspace Assignment 2 Dropbox prior to the deadline. If you are not sure of how best to capture such a video, seek advice from the instructor prior to the deadline.

NOTE: MAKE SURE TO SHOW EVERYTHING IN THE VIDEO SUBMISSION CHECKLIST STEP-BY-STEP. YOU WILL NEED AUDIO IN THE VIDEO FOR AT LEAST THE CODE REVIEW PORTION OF THE CHECKLIST
